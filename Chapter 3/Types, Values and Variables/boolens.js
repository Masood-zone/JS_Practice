// Boolean Values
//Falsy values can be of the following
undefined;
null;
0 - 0;
NaN;
("");

//All other objects and arrays are truthy values

//Null and Undefined
/*Null is used to indicate the abscence of a value and can also be an expected abscence of that value*/

/*Undefined on the other hand, is like an unexpected, error-like abscence of a value */
